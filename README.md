# project_samples
This repository contains various projects that I have worked on in the past few years. 

Most Recent projects/labs regarding data visualization/Pandas/SQL: <br/>
Pandas - various ipython notebooks that explore and use Pandas to manipulate and clean data <br/>
simple_SQLLite - ipython notebooks that use SQLLite to access and work with databases <br/>
data_exploration_baseball_project - ipython notebook that uses pandas dataframes to explore a large data set and clean the data set as to prepare the set to be used for various data science techniques. 

Other interesting algorithms and data structures: <br/>
dynamic_optimization - using dynamic optimization to solve the cake eating problem <br/>
line_search_algorithms - create various line search algorithms such as Newton's method and gradient descent <br/>
Simplex_method - creates a simplex algorithm to solve linear constrained optimization problems <br/>
Interior_point_method1 - creates and uses an interior point method for linear programs <br/>
Interior_point_method2 - creates and uses an interior point method for quadratic programs <br/>
PageRank_algorithm - creates a page rank algorithm and uses it on a college basketball dataset <br/>
data_structures_1_linked_lists - created linked lists that stored data and used it for stacks, heaps, and dequeues <br/>
data_structures_2_trees - created a binary tree and a simple implementation of constructing an AVL tree <br/>
breadth_first_search - creating and implementing a breadth first search on a dataset from IMDB to solve the "Kevin Bacon problem" <br/>
