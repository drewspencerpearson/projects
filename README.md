# projects
This repository contains various projects that I have worked on in the past few years.

I have seperated the projects into seperate files:

Fantasy_Baseball_Project: <br/>
This file contains a large data science project I completed with two colleagues. The file contains multiple .py helper files as well as a .ipynb file called csv files, which is the notebook we used to clean all the data and set up usable pandas dataframes. The Final_Project.ipynb is the actual write up of the project with the data visualization. Ultimately, we used various machine learning algorithms such as xgboost, SVM, random forests, etc. to try and classify if a given projection for a professional baseball player will be correct for the upcoming season.

data_visualization_analysis_and_pandas: <br/>
This file contains ipython notebooks that are various projects/labs I completed with data analysis/visualization using SQL or Pandas dataframes. The projects are: <br/>
Pandas - various ipython notebooks that explore and use Pandas to manipulate and clean data <br/>
simple_SQLLite - ipython notebooks that use SQLLite to access and work with databases <br/>
data_exploration_baseball_project - ipython notebook that uses pandas dataframes to explore a large data set and clean the data set as to prepare the set to be used for various data science techniques. 

algorithms_and_data_structures: <br/>
This file contains various labs regarding data structures and important algorithms like Simplex method etc. Here are the names of the various projects in this file: <br/>
dynamic_optimization - using dynamic optimization to solve the cake eating problem <br/>
line_search_algorithms - create various line search algorithms such as Newton's method and gradient descent <br/>
Simplex_method - creates a simplex algorithm to solve linear constrained optimization problems <br/>
Interior_point_method1 - creates and uses an interior point method for linear programs <br/>
Interior_point_method2 - creates and uses an interior point method for quadratic programs <br/>
PageRank_algorithm - creates a page rank algorithm and uses it on a college basketball dataset <br/>
data_structures_1_linked_lists - created linked lists that stored data and used it for stacks, heaps, and dequeues <br/>
data_structures_2_trees - created a binary tree and a simple implementation of constructing an AVL tree <br/>
breadth_first_search - creating and implementing a breadth first search on a dataset from IMDB to solve the "Kevin Bacon problem" <br/>

miscellaneous_labs: <br/>
This file contains miscellaneous school labs or projects such as filtering/convultion, understanding numpy/scipy, plotting, monte carlo integration, optimization packages, and more.
