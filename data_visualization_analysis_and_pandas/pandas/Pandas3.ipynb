    "This plot was used by the grouby method in pandas grouping different clarities together. The data is from a py dataset called diamonds. The clarity is a measure of how clear the diamond is, with the order being the following: I1 (worst), SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF (best). So, this graph shows that the mean price of diamonds in the best clarity category are actually lower than diamonds in the worst clarity category. It also shows that in general clarity is not a great indicator as to which diamonds will be the most expensive. So, what are the big takeaways and learning from this graph? This graph helps us understand where we need to dive deeper. We need to see why the mean price of the worst clarity is greater than the mean price of the best clarity, so maybe we need to like at the mean weight of stones in each category as well as the cuts in each category. So, like many graphs, this graph does not answer any specific questions, but it gives us more direction on where to look. "

It also states that a woman, no matter what city she departs from she has a higher chance of survival than any given male.

Also, length of treatment did not seem to have much of an impact. However, what is extremely important is the first 200 days after one begins treatment.

So, if I was presenting this to a company my biggest commitment to them would be to look into the different sites. See if they can find differences between site 0 and site 1. Finally, instruct them to look for any reasons why whites tend to do better at site 1, while non-whites do better at site 0. What type of employees are working at these sites? Are there more non-white doctors at site 0? These questions could provide some insights into how to help reduce re-lapse based on race. "
